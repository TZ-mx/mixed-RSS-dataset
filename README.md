Among them, one-human and multi-humans indicate that one and more pedestrians exist in the sensing area respectively. Similarly, one-motorcycle, multi-motorcycles, one-vehicle and multi-vehicles respectively mean that there is one motorcycle, multiple motorcycles, one vehicle and multiple vehicles in the wireless environment. Mixed-users is also constructed in the dataset, which represents two or more different types of road users in the wireless environment.
