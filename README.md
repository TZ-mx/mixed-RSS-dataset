# mixed-RSS-dataset
The seven-categories dataset, comprised of approximately 4,000 samples, is categorized into seven distinct types: "one-human," "multi-humans," "one-motorcycle," "multi-motorcycles," "one-vehicle," "multi-vehicles," and "mixed-users." The "one-human" and "multi-humans" categories signify the presence of a single pedestrian and multiple pedestrians, respectively, within the sensing area. In a similar vein, "one-motorcycle" and "multi-motorcycles" denote the existence of a single motorcycle and several motorcycles, respectively, in the wireless environment. Likewise, "one-vehicle" and "multi-vehicles" indicate the presence of a single vehicle and multiple vehicles. The "mixed-users" category is also included in the dataset, representing scenarios where two or more different types of road users coexist in the wireless environment.

The "new_data" file introduces additional data to this dataset. This newly incorporated data adheres to the same categorical framework as before but is distinctive in that it was collected in various environmental conditions, enriching the dataset's diversity and applicability.
